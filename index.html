            <li>Records trace the history of soccer back more than 2,000 years ago to ancient China. Greece, Rome, and parts of Central America also claim to have started the sport; but it was England that transitioned soccer, or what the British and many other people around the world call “football,” into the game we know today.</li>
            <li>More than 240 million people around the world play soccer regularly according to the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The game has evolved from the sport of kicking a rudimentary animal-hide ball around into the World Cup sport it is today.</li>

            <li>The date was November 12, 1892, a day that would forever be etched in sports history, although no one involved that day could possibly have recognized the importance of the occasion. It was the day that the Allegheny Athletic Association football team defeated the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The game in itself was not a momentous event. But one of the circumstances of the game did make it a never-to-be-forgotten moment in sports history – one of the AAA players, William (Pudge) Heffelfinger, was openly paid $500 to play the game.</li>
            <li>American football continues to expand and expand in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Brazil and China.There is no other sport more closely associated with the United States than football.</li>

            <li>History of baseball is a little more complicated than the Doubleday legend. References to games resembling baseball in the United States date back to the 18th century. Its most direct ancestors appear to be two English games: rounders (a children’s game brought to New England by the earliest colonists) and cricket.</li>
            <li>Baseball is played around the world, however it is most popular, in the US, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Canada with Central American countries also ranking high. M.L.B. teams play at least 2,430 regular-season games each season, compared with only 256 regular-season games for the N.F.L. and 1,230 for the N.B.A.</li>
